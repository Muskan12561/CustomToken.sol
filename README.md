# CustomToken.sol
This project demonstrates creating an ERC20 token named "Binance Coin" (BNB) using Solidity. The contract, deployable via HardHat or Remix, allows the owner to mint tokens to any address. Users can burn their tokens and transfer tokens between addresses. The implementation uses OpenZeppelin for best practices and security.
